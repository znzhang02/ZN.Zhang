Research experience
======
* EV Hosting Capacity Analysis &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _June 2024-present_
  * Designed EV charging policies, and calculated the probability a specific EV will charge in the station, thus obtaining the power demand in a scenario.
  * Utilized DistFlow model to test in each scenario whether it's feasible to build certain number of EV chargers.
  * Prepare to apply probability knowledge like Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to avoid over-conservation and calculated the EV hosting capacity under certain probability.
  * Prepare to write and submit a journal.

* Multi-Timescale Energy Management of Virtual Power Plant &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _July 2023-April 2024_
  * Established a multi-energy virtual power plant (MEVPP) with 4 kinds of coupling networks and multiple distributed devices, and considered carbon trading mechanism and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) interaction.
  * Took carbon emission and peak-valley difference into consideration by adding penalty or compensation, transferring unquantifiable environment and grid stability effect into quantifiable economic effect.
  * Utilized a two-stage multi-objective particle swarm optimization to obtain the best dispatch plan.
  * Wrote and submitted 2 papers. One conference paper was accepted, and one journal paper is under review.
